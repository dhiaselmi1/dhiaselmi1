## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Mohamed Dhia Selmi, a software engineering student currently interning in AI with the School of AI. I recently developed a web project in collaboration with TGM Galerie, blending tech and creativity.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on full-stack development and artificial intelligence projects. My work spans from building interactive web applications to exploring real-world AI solutions that can make a difference.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge in data science, machine learning, and AI. Iâ€™m exploring tools and frameworks such as Python, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn, while also focusing on building a strong foundation in data analysis and model deployment.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on innovative and impactful tech projects â€” especially those at the intersection of AI, sustainability, and user-centric design. I'm always open to learning from others and growing through teamwork.
